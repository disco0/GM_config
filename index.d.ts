     * ### About Fields
     * 
     *   Each type of field that `GM_config` supports allows a different type of value to 
     * be saved using the GUI.
     * 
     * #### Common field properties:
     * 
     *   1) All fields have default values that will be used if you don't include a 
     *      `default` property with your field definition.
     * 
     *   2) All fields can optionally have a label element that can be set using a `label` 
     *      property that can be either a string or a DOM element. If the `label` property 
     *      is listed first in the field definition, it will appear to the left of the 
     *      field, otherwise it will appear to the right. Sometimes this can get annoying 
     *      so you can use a "labelPos" property with a value of either `left`, `right`, 
     *      `above`, or `below` to control the position of the label in relation to the 
     *      field.
     * 
     *   3) All fields can have a `title` property that will show the text as a tooltip 
     *      when hovering over the field.

         * of "text". The difference is that GM_config enforces that "int" and "float"
         * fields actually conform to those datatypes, and prevents the user from entering
         * invalid data. Both "int" and "float" types can be prefixed with "unsigned" to
         * ensure the value entered is non-negative.
